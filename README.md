# Vivo-Center

### The following instructions are only applied if you want to change API host to localhost

  - APP
  - API

### **** APP ****

```sh
Just need to change global "API_host" in Session Class to "http:/localhost".
```

### **** API ****

```sh
INSTALL https://www.meteor.com/ (Back-End - comes with nodejs already)
$ cd Vivo-Center/VIVO-API and write "meteor" on terminal
Probably there is a few packages missing, to fix it just follow what is said on terminal to install those packages ( takes like 20s )
After that, API should be UP and RUNNING (DONE)
